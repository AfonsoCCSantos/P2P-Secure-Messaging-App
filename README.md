# P2P Secure Messaging 

A P2P secure messaging app that offers the following functionalities:
- End-to-end encrypted 1-1 P2P conversations
- Encrypted group conversations using Attribute-Based-Encryption
- Messaging Searching using Symmetric Searchable Encryption

This application still relies on a server to query users, ie, to get the ip:port of another use so it is possible to establish a connection.
The server also manages the groups.

## Future Plans
- Make the application as descentralised as possible, getting rid of the current server
- Improve security across the application
